            <p>Food Donation Connection provides an alternative to discarding surplus wholesome food by linking food
                service donors with surplus food to local hunger relief agencies. We do this by creating and maintaining
                an efficient communication and reporting network that links available sources of food to those in need
                through these existing charitable organizations.</p>

            <h1>Shelter for a family</h1>
            <p>otational shelter is Family Promise’s original shelter model. The rotational shelter model engages a
                network of community partners, often faith communities, to house families with children in different
                locations on a rotational basis. This innovative model— mobilizing volunteers to help house families in
                community space—has helped over one million children and adults in our national network of 200+
                Affiliates.</p>
